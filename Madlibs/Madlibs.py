    Review in The {city} Times. If the {plural_noun2} featured there are too {adj3} \
    for your taste, try something a little more low-{part_of_body}, like {letter_of_alphabet}:\
    The {celebrity} Magazine, or {plural_noun3} Magazine. You could also choose a book the \
    {adj4} - fashioned way. Head in to your local library or {place} and browse the shelves until something\
    catches your {part_of_body2}. Or, you could save yourself with a whole lot of {adj5} trouble\
    and log on to {website}, the {adj6} new website to {verb} for books! \
